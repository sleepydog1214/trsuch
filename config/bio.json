I then went to School of Art at the University of Michigan, where I earned a BFA. When I graduated, I was creating mostly sculptural ceramic pieces. One of the best ceramic artists around, Suzanne Stephenson, was teaching at Eastern Michigan University. I applied there, and then two years later I earned an MFA. I also married my beautiful wife Janice while in graduate school.",
  "After art school, my wife and I moved to Houghton, Michigan. This was in Michigan’s upper peninsula, right on Lake Superior. While my wife practiced law, I went back to school at Michigan Technological University. Here I earned a BS and MS in Computer Science. I admit I went back to school for practical reasons, as a way to supplement my struggling artist career. I also found I loved programming. Starting with a blank terminal when coding reminds me of starting with a blank canvas when painting.",
"At Michigan Tech, I studied under Dr. Phil Sweany and Dr. Steven Carr. They both specialize in compilers, and I worked on optimizing register allocation for my master’s thesis. While at MTU, I began an internship at Texas Instruments in Stafford, Texas. TI’s DSP compiler group was based there, and I began my career there in 1996. Over the next two decades I’ve worked on a number of different projects for the compiler team. Check out my curriculum vitae for more details on my experience and skills.",
"I currently reside in Richmond, Texas, a suburb west of Houston. I live there with my wife and two daughters, as well as our two dogs. Over the past year I’ve built both a painting a ceramic studio, and I love spending time creating. You can find my art work at my page suchytastudio.com."]
